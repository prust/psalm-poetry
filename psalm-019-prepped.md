# Psalm 19

*The book of nature and scripture*

Great God, the heaven's well-ordered frame  
declares the glories of Your name;  
there Your rich works of wonder shine:  
a thousand starry beauties **there**  
a thousand radiant marks **appear**  
of boundless power and skill divine.

From night to day, from day to night  
the dawning and the dying light  
lectures of heavenly wisdom read;  
with silent eloquence they raise  
our thoughts to our Creator's praise  
and neither sound nor language need.

Yet their divine instructions run  
far as the journeys of the sun  
and every nation knows their voice;  
the sun, like some young bridegroom **dressed**  
breaks from the chambers of the **east**  
rolls round and makes the earth rejoice.

**Where'er** he spreads his beams abroad  
he smiles and speaks his maker, God  
all nature joins to show Your **praise**  
thus God, in every creature shines  
fair is the book of nature's lines  
but fairer is Your book of **grace**.

* * *

I love the volumes of Your **word**  
What light and joy those **leaves** **afford**  
to souls **benighted** and distressed;  
Your precepts guide my doubtful way  
Your fear forbids my feet to stray  
Your promise leads my heart to rest.

From the discoveries of Your law  
the perfect rules of life I draw  
these are my study and delight:  
not honey so invites the taste  
or gold, that has the furnace passed  
appears so pleasing to the sight.

Your **threatenings** wake my slumbering eyes  
and warn me where my danger lies  
but its Your blessed gospel, Lord  
that makes my guilty conscience **clean**  
converts my soul, subdues my **sin**  
and gives a free but **large** reward.

Who knows the errors of his **thoughts**?  
My God, forgive my secret **faults**  
and from presumptuous sins restrain;  
accept my poor attempts of praise  
that I have read Your book of grace  
and book of nature, not in vain.
