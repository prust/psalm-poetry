# Psalm 11

*God loves the righteous and hates the wicked*

My refuge is the God of love;  
why do my **foes** insult and cry:  
“Fly like a **timorous** trembling dove  
to distant woods or mountains fly”?

If government is all destroyed  
(that firm foundation of our peace)  
and violence make justice void  
where shall the righteous seek **redress**?

The Lord in heaven has fixed his throne  
His eye surveys the world below;  
to Him all mortal things are known  
His **eyelids** search our spirits **through**.

If He afflicts His saints so far  
to prove their love and try their **grace**  
what may the bold transgressors fear?  
His very soul **abhors** their **ways**.

On **impious** wretches he shall rain  
tempests of brimstone, fire and death  
such as He kindled on the plain  
of Sodom with His angry breath.

The righteous Lord loves righteous souls  
whose thoughts and actions are **sincere**  
and with a gracious eye beholds  
the men that His own image **bear**.
