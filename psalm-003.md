# Psalm 3

*A morning Psalm*

Lord, how my rivals multiply  
in this weak state of flesh and blood;  
my worries swell up to the sky  
but God will save me from the flood.

Tired from the burdens of the day  
I knelt, confessing all my fear;  
You heard when I began to pray  
and Your almighty help was near.

Now sleeping by Your heavenly aid  
I drifted to a distant shore;  
not even death made me afraid  
though I should wake and rise no more.

But God sustained me through the night  
and proved that He is kind and strong;  
He raised my head to see the light  
and made His praise my morning song.
