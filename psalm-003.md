# Psalm 3

*A morning Psalm*

Oh Lord, how many are my **foes**  
in this weak state of flesh and **blood**;  
my peace they daily discompose  
but my defence and hope is **God**.

Tired with the burdens of the day  
to You I **poured out** all my fear;  
You heard when I began to pray  
and Your almighty help was near.

Supported by Your heavenly aid  
I **laid me down** and slept **secure**;  
**not death** should make my heart afraid  
though I should wake and rise no **more**.

But God sustained me all the night  
salvation does to God belong;  
He raised my head to see the light  
and made His praise my morning song.
