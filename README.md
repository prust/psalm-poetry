*A Christian paraphrase of the Psalms*

*by Isaac Watts; modernized*

# Introduction

Isaac Watts paraphrase of the Psalms was originally titled "The Psalms of David: Imitated in the Language of the New Testament and Applied to the Christian State and Worship".

This effort, titled "Psalm Poetry: A Christian paraphrase of the Psalms", modernizes Isaac Watt original while keeping it in the public domain ([the CC0 license](LICENSE)). The goal is to update all archaic words, idioms and patterns of speech, as well as the rhymes that no longer rhyme with modern English pronunciation. We retain Watts' meter (Common Meter, Short Meter or Long Meter), but in some cases we simplify the rhyme scheme to only rhyme the 2nd and 4th lines.
