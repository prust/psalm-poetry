# Psalm 20

*Prayer and hope of victory. For a day of prayer in time of war*

Now may the God of power and grace  
attend His people's humble cry  
Jehovah hears when Israel prays  
and brings deliverance from on high.

The name of Jacob's God defends  
better than shields or brazen walls;  
He from his sanctuary sends  
**succour** and strength, when Zion calls.

Well He remembers all our **sighs**  
His love exceeds our best **deserts**  
His love accepts the **sacrifice**  
of humble **groans** and broken **hearts**.

In His salvation is our **hope**  
and in the name of Israel's God  
our troops shall lift their banners **up**  
our navies spread their flags abroad.

Some trust in horses trained for war  
and some, of chariots make their boast  
our **surest** expectations are  
from You, the Lord of heavenly hosts.

Now save us, Lord, from **slavish** fear  
now let our hopes be firm and strong  
until salvation shall appear  
and joy and triumph raise the song.
