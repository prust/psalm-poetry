# Psalm 10

*Prayer heard and saints saved*

Why does the Lord stand off so far  
and why conceal His **face**  
when great calamities appear  
and times of deep **distress**?

Lord, shall the wicked still **deride**  
Your justice and Your power?  
Shall they **advance their heads** in pride  
and still Your saints devour?

They put Your judgments from their sight  
and then insult the poor;  
they boast in their exalted height  
that they will fall no more.

Arise, Oh God, lift up Your hand  
**attend** our humble cry;  
no enemy shall dare to stand  
when God ascends on high.

* * *

Why do the men of malice rage  
and say with foolish pride  
“The God of heaven will **ne'er** engage  
to fight on Zion's side?”

But You forever are our Lord  
and powerful is Your hand  
as when the pagans felt Your sword  
and perished from Your land.

You will prepare our hearts to pray  
and cause Your ear to hear;  
He **hearkens** what His children say  
and puts the world in fear.

Proud tyrants shall no more oppress  
no more despise the just  
and mighty sinners shall confess  
they are but earth and dust.
