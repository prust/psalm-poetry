# Psalm 1

*The way and end of the righteous and the wicked*

How blessed, one who avoids the place  
where sinners love to meet;  
who fears to walk their wicked ways  
and hates the mocker's seat.

In the commands and voice of God  
they take such great delight;  
by day they read or hear the word  
and meditate by night.

Green as the leaf and ever fair  
shall their ambitions shine,  
while fruits of holiness appear  
like clusters on the vine.

Not so the wicked and unjust  
what vain designs they form;  
their hopes are blown away like dust  
or chaff before the storm.

Sinners, in judgment, shall not stand  
among the sons of grace,  
when Christ the Judge, at His right hand  
appoints His saints a place.

The lines they walk, His eye will read  
His heart approves it well;  
but crooked ways of sinners lead  
down to the gates of hell.
