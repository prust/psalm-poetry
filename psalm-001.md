# Psalm 1

*The way and end of the righteous and the wicked*

Blessed is the one who **shuns** the place  
where sinners love to meet  
Who fears to walk their wicked ways  
and hates the mocker's seat

In the commands and voice of God  
they take such great delight  
By day they read or hear the word  
and meditate by night

Green as the leaf and ever fair  
shall their **endeavors** shine  
While fruits of holiness appear  
like clusters on the vine

Not so the wicked and unjust  
what vain designs they form  
Their hopes are blown away like dust  
or chaff before the storm

Sinners, in judgment, shall not stand  
among the sons of grace  
When Christ the Judge, at His right hand  
appoints His saints a place

The lines they walk, His eye will read  
His heart approves it well  
But crooked ways of sinners lead  
down to the gates of hell
