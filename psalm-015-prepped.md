# Psalm 15

*Religion and justice, goodness and truth*

Who shall **ascend** Your heavenly place  
great God, and dwell **before Your face**?  
The one that **minds** religion **now**  
and humbly walks with God **below**.

Whose hands are pure, whose heart is clean  
whose lips still speak the thing they mean  
no slander dwells upon their tongue  
they hate to do their neighbour wrong.

Yet when their **holiest** works are done  
their soul depends on grace alone;  
this is the one Your face will see  
and dwell forever, Lord, with **Thee**.
