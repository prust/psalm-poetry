# Psalm 7

*God's care of His people and punishment of persecutors*

My trust is in my heavenly Friend  
my hope in You, my **God**;  
rise and my helpless life defend  
from those that seek my **blood**.

With insolence and fury they  
**My soul in pieces tear**,  
as hungry lions **rend** the prey  
when no **deliverer's** near.

If I had **e'er** provoked them first,  
or once abused my **foe**,  
then let him tread my life to dust  
and lay mine honor low.

If there is **malice** found in me  
I know Your piercing eyes;  
I should not dare appeal to You  
or ask my God to rise.

Arise, my God, lift up Your hand  
their pride and power control;  
awake to judgment and **command**  
**deliverance** for my soul.

* * *

Let sinners and their wicked rage  
be humbled to the dust;  
will not the God of truth engage  
to vindicate the just?

He knows the heart, he **tries the reins**  
He will defend **th'** upright:  
His sharpest arrows he ordains  
against the sons of spite.

For me, their malice dug a pit  
but there **themselves are cast**;  
my God makes all their mischief **light**  
on their own heads at last.

That cruel persecuting race  
must feel His dreadful sword;  
awake, my soul, and praise the grace  
and justice of the Lord.
