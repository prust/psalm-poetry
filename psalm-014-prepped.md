# Psalm 14

## Part 1

*By nature all men are sinners*

Fools in their hearts believe and say  
that “all religion's **vain**,  
“There is no God that reigns on high  
or **minds** the affairs of **men**.”

From thoughts so dreadful and profane  
corrupt discourse **proceeds**;  
and in their **impious** hands are found  
**Abominable** deeds.

The Lord, from His celestial throne  
looked down on things below  
to find the one that sought His grace  
or did His justice know.

By nature all have gone astray  
their practice all the same;  
there's none that fears their Maker's hand  
there's none that loves His name.

Their tongues are **used to** speak deceit  
their slanders never cease;  
how swift to **mischief** are their feet  
**Nor knew** the paths of peace.

Such seeds of sin (that bitter root)  
in every heart are found;  
nor can they bear **diviner** fruit,  
till grace **refine** the ground.

## Part 2

*The folly of persecutors*

Are sinners now so senseless grown  
that they Your saints devour?  
And never worship at Your throne  
or fear Your **awful** power?

Great God appear to their surprise  
reveal Your dreadful name;  
let them no more Your wrath despise  
or turn our hope to shame.

Do You not dwell among the just?  
and yet our foes **deride**  
that we should make Your name our trust;  
great God, confound their pride.

Oh that the joyful day would come  
to finish our **distress**!  
When God will bring His children home  
our songs will never **cease**.
