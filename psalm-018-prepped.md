# Psalm 18

## Part 1

*Deliverance from despair*

You will I love, Oh Lord, my strength  
my rock, my tower, my high defence;  
Your mighty arm will be my trust  
for I have found salvation **thence**.

Death and the terrors of the grave  
stood 'round me with their **dismal** shade;  
while floods of **high** temptations rose  
and made my sinking soul afraid.

I saw the opening gates of hell  
with endless pains and sorrows there,  
which none but they that feel can tell  
while I was **hurried** to despair.

In my distress I called “my God”  
when I could **scarce** believe Him mine;  
He **bowed** His ear to my **complaint**  
then did His grace appear divine.

With speed He flew to my **relief**  
as on a **cherub's** wing he **rode**;  
awful and bright as lightning shone  
the face of my deliverer, **God**.

Temptations fled at His rebuke  
the blast of His almighty breath;  
He sent salvation from on high  
and drew me from the depths of death.

Great were my fears, my **foes** were great  
much was their strength and more their rage  
but Christ, my Lord, is conqueror still  
in all the wars that devils wage.

My song for ever shall record  
that terrible, that joyful hour  
and give the glory to the Lord  
**due to** His mercy and His power.

## Part 2

*Sincerity proved and rewarded*

Lord, You have seen my soul sincere,  
have made Your truth and love appear;  
before my eyes I set Your laws  
and You have owned my righteous cause.

Since I have learned Your holy ways  
I walked upright **before Your face**  
or if my feet did **e'er** depart  
**'Twas** never with a wicked heart.

What sore temptations broke my rest  
what wars and strugglings in my **breast**!  
But through Your grace that reigns within  
I guard against my **darling** sin:

That sin which close **besets** me still  
that works and strives against my will;  
when shall Your Spirit's sovereign **power**  
destroy it that it rise no **more**?

With an impartial hand, the Lord  
deals out to mortals their reward;  
the kind and faithful souls shall find  
a God as faithful and as kind.

The just and pure shall ever say  
Your are more pure, more just than they  
and men that love revenge shall **know**  
God has an arm of vengeance **too**.

## Part 3

*Salvation and triumph*

Just are Your ways and true Your word  
great rock of my secure **abode**;  
who is a God beside the **Lord**  
or **where's** a refuge like our **God**?

It's He that **girds** me with His might  
gives me His holy sword to wield  
and while with sin and hell I fight  
spreads His salvation for my shield.

He lives (and blessed be my **rock**)  
the God of my salvation lives;  
the dark designs of hell are **broke**;  
sweet is the peace my Father gives.

Before the scoffers of the age  
I will exalt my Father's name  
**Nor** tremble at their mighty rage  
but **meet** reproach and bear the shame.

To David and his royal **seed**  
Your grace forever shall extend;  
Your love to saints in Christ their **head**  
knows not a limit or an end.
