# Psalm 5

*For Sunday morning*

Lord, in the morning You will hear  
my voice ascending high;  
to You will I direct my prayer  
to You lift up my eye;

Up to the hills where Christ has gone  
to plead for all His saints,  
presenting at His Father's throne  
our songs and our complaints.

You are a God before whose sight  
the wicked will not stand;  
sinners will **ne'er** be Your delight  
or dwell at Your right hand.

But to Your house I will **resort**  
to taste Your mercies **there**;  
I will frequent Your holy court  
and worship in Your **fear**

Oh may Your Spirit guide my feet  
in ways of **righteousness**;  
make every path of duty straight  
and plain before my **face**.

* * *

My watchful enemies **combine**  
to tempt my feet **astray**;  
they flatter with a **base design**  
to make my soul their prey.

Lord, crush the serpent in the dust  
and all his plots destroy;  
while those who in Your mercy trust  
forever shout for joy.

The men that love and fear Your name  
will see their hopes **fulfilled**;  
our mighty God will cover them  
with favour as a **shield**.
