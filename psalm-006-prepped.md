# Psalm 6

*Complaint in sickness*

In anger, Lord, rebuke me **not**  
withdraw the dreadful storm;  
**nor** let Your fury grow so hot  
against a feeble **worm**

My soul's bowed down with heavy cares  
my flesh with pain oppressed;  
my bed is witness to my tears  
my tears forbid my rest.

Sorrow and pain wear out my days;  
I waste the night with cries  
counting the minutes as they pass  
till the slow morning rise.

Will I be still tormented more;  
my eye consumed with grief?  
How long, my God, how long before  
Your hand provide relief?

He hears when dust and ashes speak  
He pities all our groans  
He saves us for His mercy's sake  
and heals our broken bones.

The virtue of His sovereign word  
restores our fainting breath;  
For silent graves don't praise the Lord,  
**Nor** is He known in death.
