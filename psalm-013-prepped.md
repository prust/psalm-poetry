# Psalm 13

*Pleading with God when deserted*

How long, 0h Lord, shall I complain  
like one that seeks his God in vain?  
Can You Your face forever hide  
and I still pray and be denied?

Will I forever **be forgot**  
as one whom You **remember not**?  
Still will my soul Your absence **mourn**  
and still despair of Your **return**?

How long shall my poor troubled **breast**  
be with these anxious thoughts oppressed?  
And Satan, my malicious **foe**,  
rejoice to see me sunk so low.

Hear, Lord, and grant me quick relief  
before my death conclude my grief;  
if You withhold Your heavenly light  
I sleep in everlasting night.

How will the powers of darkness **boast**  
if just one praying soul is **lost**!  
But I have trusted in Your grace  
and shall again **behold** Your face.

**Whate'er** my fears or foes suggest  
You are my hope, my joy, my rest;  
my heart will feel Your love and raise  
my cheerful voice to songs of praise.
