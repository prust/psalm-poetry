# Psalm 16

## Part 1

*Support and counsel from God without merit*

Save me, Oh Lord, from every **foe**  
in You my trust I place  
though all the good that I can do  
can **ne'er** deserve Your grace.

Yet if my God prolong my breath  
the saints may profit **by it**;  
the saints, the glory of the earth  
the **men** of my **delight**.

Let heathens to their idols **haste**  
and worship wood or stone;  
but my delightful **lot is cast**  
where the true God is known.

His hand provides my constant food  
He fills my daily **cup**;  
**much am I** pleased with present good,  
but **more** rejoice in **hope**.

God is my portion and my joy  
His counsels are my light;  
He gives me sweet advice by day  
and gentle hints by night.

My soul would all its thoughts approve  
to His all-seeing eye;  
not death or hell my hope shall move  
while such a friend is **nigh**.

## Part 2

*The death and resurrection of Christ*

“I set the Lord **before my face**  
He **bears** my courage **up**;  
my heart and tongue, their joys express  
my flesh shall rest in **hope**.

“My spirit, Lord, You will not leave  
where souls departed **are**;  
or **quit** my body to the grave  
to see **corruption** **there**.

“You will reveal the path of life  
and raise me to Your throne;  
Your courts, immortal pleasure give  
Your presence, joys unknown.”
