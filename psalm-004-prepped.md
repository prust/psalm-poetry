# Psalm 4

*God our portion and Christ our hope*

Oh God of grace and righteousness  
Hear and attend when I complain;  
You have enlarged me in distress  
bow down a gracious ear again.

You sons of men, in vain you try  
To turn my glory into shame;  
how long will mockers love to lie  
and dare reproach my Savior's name.

Know that the Lord divides his saints  
from all the tribes of men **beside**;  
He hears the cry of penitents  
for the **dear** sake of Christ who died.

When our obedient hands have done  
a thousand works of **righteousness**  
we put our trust in God alone  
and glory in His pardoning **grace**.

Let the unthinking many say  
"Who will **bestow** some earthly good?"  
But, Lord, Your light and love we pray  
our souls desire this heavenly food.

Then shall my cheerful **powers** rejoice  
at grace and favour so divine;  
nor will I change my happy choice  
for all their bread and all their wine.
