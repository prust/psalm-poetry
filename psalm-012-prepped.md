# Psalm 12

*Sins of the tongue: blasphemy, falsehood, etc*

Lord, if You do not soon appear  
virtue and truth will fly away;  
a faithful man, among us here  
will scarce be found if You delay.

The whole **discourse** when neighbours meet  
is filled with trifles loose and vain;  
their lips are flattery and deceit  
and their proud language is profane.

But lips, that with deceit abound  
shall not maintain their triumph **long**;  
the God of vengeance will confound  
the flattering and blaspheming **tongue**.

“Yet will our words be free,” they cry  
“Our tongue will be controlled by **none**;  
where is the Lord to ask us why?  
or say our lips are not our **own**?”

The Lord who sees the poor oppressed  
and hears the oppressor's haughty strain  
will rise to give His children rest  
nor shall they trust His word in vain.

Your word, Oh Lord, though often tried  
void of deceit shall still appear  
**Not silver**, seven times purified  
from dross and **mixture**, shines so clear.

Your grace shall in the darkest hour  
defend the holy soul from harm;  
though when the vilest men have power  
on every side will sinners swarm.
