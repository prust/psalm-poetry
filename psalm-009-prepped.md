# Psalm 9

## Part 1

*Wrath and mercy from the judgment seat*

With my whole heart I'll raise my song  
Your wonders I'll proclaim;  
**Thou** sovereign judge of right and wrong  
will put my **foes** to shame.

I'll sing Your majesty and grace;  
my God prepares his throne  
to judge the world in righteousness  
and make his **vengeance** known.

Then will the Lord **a refuge prove**  
for all the poor oppressed  
to save the people of His love  
and give the weary rest.

The men that know Your name will trust  
in Your abundant grace;  
for You have **ne'er** **forsook** the just  
who humbly seek Your face.

Sing praises to the righteous Lord  
Who dwells on Zion's hill  
Who executes his threatening word  
and does His grace fulfil.

## Part 2

*The wisdom and equity of providence*

When the great Judge, supreme and just  
will once **inquire for blood**  
The humble souls that mourn in dust  
will find a faithful God.

He from the dreadful gates of death  
does His own children raise;  
in Zion's gates, with cheerful breath  
they sing their Father's praise.

His **foes** shall fall with heedless feet  
into the pit they **made**;  
and sinners perish in the net  
that their own hands had **spread**.

Thus by Your judgments, mighty God  
are Your deep counsels known;  
when men of **mischief** are destroyed  
the snare must be their own.

* * *

The wicked shall sink down to hell;  
Your wrath devour the lands  
that dare forget You or rebel  
against Your **known** commands.

Though saints to sore distress are brought  
and wait and long complain  
their cries shall not be **still** forgot  
**nor** shall their hopes be vain.

Rise, great Redeemer, from Your seat  
To judge and save the poor;  
Let nations tremble at Your feet  
and men prevail no more.

Your thunder shall **affright** the proud,  
and **put their hearts to pain**;  
make them confess that You are God  
and they but feeble men.
