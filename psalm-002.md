# Psalm 2

*Christ dying, rising, interceding and reigning*

Why did the nations join to slay  
the Lord's anointed **Son**?  
Why did they cast his laws away  
and tread his gospel **down**?

The Lord that sits above the skies  
laughs at their rage below;  
He speaks with vengeance in his eyes  
and shatters sword and bow.

"I call him my Eternal Son  
and raise him from the dead;  
I make my holy hill his throne  
and wide his kingdom spread.

"Ask me, my Son, and then enjoy  
the farthest pagan lands;  
Your rod of iron will destroy  
the rebel that withstands."

Be wise, you rulers of the earth  
obey the anointed **Lord**;  
adore the king of heavenly birth  
and tremble at His **word**.

With humble love address His throne,  
for you don't want to die;  
those are secure and those alone  
who on his grace rely.
