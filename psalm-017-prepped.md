# Psalm 17

*The sinner's portion, the saint's hope*

Lord, I am Yours, but You will **prove**  
my faith, my patience and my love;  
when men of spite against me **join**  
they are the sword, the hand is **thine**.

Their hope and portion lies below  
its all the happiness they know;  
its all they seek, they take their shares  
and leave the rest among their heirs.

What sinners value, I resign  
Lord, its enough that You are mine;  
I will behold Your **blissful** **face**  
and stand complete in **righteousness**.

This life's a dream, an empty show  
but the bright world to which I go  
has joys substantial and **sincere**  
when will I wake and **find me** **there**?

Oh glorious hour, oh blessed **abode**  
I will be near and like my **God**!  
And flesh and sin no more control  
the sacred pleasures of the soul.

My flesh will slumber in the ground  
**til** the last trumpet's joyful sound  
then burst the chains with sweet surprise  
and in my Savior's image rise.
