# Psalm 8

## Part 1

*The hosanna of the children*

Almighty Ruler of the skies  
through the wide earth Your name is **spread**  
and Your eternal glories rise  
**O'er** all the heavens Your hands have **made**.

To You the voices of the young  
a monument of honour raise  
and babes with uninstructed tongue  
declare the wonders of Your praise.

Your power **assists their tender age**  
to bring proud rebels to the ground  
to still the bold blasphemer's rage  
and all their politics confound.

Children **amidst** Your temple throng  
to see their great Redeemer's face;  
the Son of David is their song  
and young hosannas fill the place.

The frowning scribes and angry **priests**  
in vain their **impious cavils** bring;  
revenge sits silent in their **breasts**  
while Jewish babes proclaim their king.

## Part 2

*Adam and Christ, lords of old and new creation*

**Note: Let's change the rhyme scheme to just lines 2 and 4**  
**rather than make all these rhyme**

Lord, what was man, when made at **first**  
Adam the offspring of the **dust**,  
that You should set him and his race  
**but** just below an angel's place?

That You should raise his nature so  
and make him lord of all below;  
make every beast and bird **submit**  
and lay the fishes at his **feet**?

But oh, what brighter glories wait  
to crown the second Adam's state;  
what honours **shall Your Son adorn**  
Who condescended to be born.

See Him, below His angels **made**  
see Him in dust amongst the **dead**,  
to save a ruined world from **sin**  
but he shall reign with power **divine**.

The world to come, redeemed from all  
the miseries that attend the fall,  
new made and glorious shall **submit**  
at our exalted Saviour's **feet**.
